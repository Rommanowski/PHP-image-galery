# PHP-image-galery

This project is a PHP-based photo gallery website that allows users to upload images to the server. Key features include:

- **Thumbnail Generation**: Automatically creates thumbnails for uploaded photos, which are displayed in a paginated gallery.
- **Watermarking**: Adds a user-selected watermark to the full-size images. Accessible after clicking on the thumbnail
- **User Differentiation**: Supports user accounts, enabling users to mark their uploads as private or public.
- **File Validation**: Displays errors during upload if the file format is unsupported or the size exceeds the limit, or both.
- **Shopping Cart**: Implements a "shopping cart" feature to save selected photos, accessible in a dedicated tab.
- **AJAX Search**: Includes a dynamic photo search functionality using AJAX for a seamless user experience.
